            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Before you form your Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, remember always to draw out the odd Men from every Company, Forming a Rank in Oppoſition at Fifty Paces diſtance from the Head of each Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, thereby to have no broken Files, which is much the better and quicker way to compleat your Files, then after your Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions are formed.</p>

               <p>When Pikes and Musketiers Interchange Ground the firſt Rank of Pikes paſs before the firſt Rank of Musketiers. And it is always to be obſerved, That (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any Command for moving) no Man ſtir before the Word of Command, <hi>March,</hi> be given, thereby to make them all move together.</p>
               <p>When they have thus changed Ground, they are not to Face to their Leaders till the word of Command be ſo given. At which time they are then in Battalia, but at cloſe Order in File. And now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179311:5"/>it is to be obſerved that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are no more limited to their particular Companies, but are all concerned in the whole. He that Commands, is to ſee how many Sargeants there are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and diſpoſe of them in this following manner, Viz. If a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion conſiſt of Eight, or Ten Companies, or more; And the Companies have each Two Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants, and Three Corporals, (who are deſigned to do Sarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Duty) It is neceſſary to place two on each Rank to the Right and Left, and the reſt in the Rear; But if the number of Sargeants be fewer, then there can be but one to each Rank, on the Right and Left: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder always to be in the Rear, making a Rank parallel to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179311:5"/>the Souldiers at Three Paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the laſt Rank.</p>
               <p>The Sargeants being placed in this manner: The Drums are to be diſpoſed of, one half on the Right, and the other on the Left, Ranging directly with the firſt Rank of the Souldiers, unleſs there be many Drums, and the Ground Streight; And then they are to be formed into Two Ranks, on the Right and Left, to range with the Two firſt Ranks of the Souldiers; And they are always to have their Drums ſlung, unleſs Commanded to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Hoboys to be on the Right of the Drums, which are on the Right of the Battalion, ranged in the ſame Rank with them.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſion-Officers are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179311:6"/>to take their Poſts at the head of the Battalion as the Colours are drawn. But the more particular placing of the Officers will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now it is to be obſerved, That though the Files are ſtill at their cloſe Order, the Ranks are to have their Diſtance of Twelve large Feet, which the Sargeants are to be very diligent and active to ſee kept very even.</p>
               <p>The Officer in Chief is to place himſelf before the Center of the Pikes, about forty Paces from them, the better to obſerve what is done; And that he may be more eaſily underſtood by the whole Body. He is to be on Horſe-back.</p>
               <p>The Words of Command are to be given leiſurely, that the Soldiers may have time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179311:6"/>the Exerciſe without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. And above all, Silence is to be kept very ſtrictly. And the firſt Word of Command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you begin the Exerciſe, is <hi>Silence.</hi>

               <p>The Officers that are to March in the Rear of the Diviſion are to fall after them as they March off, and not before. And the Sarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants that were Poſted in the Reat, are to take care of the Pikes in their Marching.</p>
               <p>The Drums are to be divided equally to the Diviſions, and to March between the Second and Third Rank.</p>

               <p>Whenever a Diviſion is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to March, they are to ſtep together at once, both Front and Rear with their Left Feet, and to March ſlowly.</p>

The Major General in the mean while is to Ride about the Camp to Poſt the
